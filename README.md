# NeoBot ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

A Raspberry Pi-based intelligent robot car with **obstacle avoidance** and **gesture control** features. Designed to explore smart mobility through sensor fusion, motor control, and machine learning techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Obstacle Avoidance**  
  Real-time detection using ultrasonic sensors to automatically avoid collisions.

- **Gesture Control**  
  Hand gestures detected via computer vision models (e.g., CNN) to control movement.

- **Modular Design**  
  Each functionality (obstacle, gesture, movement) implemented in separate modules and integrated seamlessly.

- **PWM Motor Control**  
  Precise direction and speed control of 4 wheels using PCA9685 and GPIO.
